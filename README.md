# asd-dashboard

ASD Dashboard is a pure VanillaJS Progressive Web App (PWA) designed for managing remote services through widgets displayed in iframes. The dashboard allows users to add, resize, reorder, and configure widgets dynamically, with all user preferences stored in localStorage to ensure persistence across sessions.

## Overview

The 'asd-dashboard' is a single-page application (SPA) built using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without any frameworks. The main components include:

- `index.html`: The main entry point with a basic layout.
- `styles.css`: The stylesheet for styling the application.
- `main.js`: The core JavaScript file for the application's functionality.
- `services.json`: A JSON file containing a list of remote services.

### Project Structure

The project is organized into several JavaScript files, each handling different features:

- `boardboardMode.js`: Implements the boardboard mode functionality for reordering widgets.
- `fetchData.js`: Handles network requests and data fetching.
- `localStorage.js`: Manages saving and loading widget states using the browser's localStorage.
- `resizeMenu.js`: Provides functionality to resize widgets.
- `serverWorkerRegistration.js`: Manages the registration and unregistration of a Service Worker.
- `serviceWorker.js`: Implements caching strategies to enhance the app's performance and offline functionality.
- `uiInteractions.js`: Initializes user interface interactions for adding, reordering, and managing widgets.
- `unicodeEmoji.js`: Contains a collection of emoji metadata for UI elements.
- `utils.js`: Provides utility functions like `debounce`.
- `widgetManagement.js`: Implements functions for creating, adding, removing, configuring, and reordering widgets.
